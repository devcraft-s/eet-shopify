CUSTOMER WORKFLOW - WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU RUN THE SYNC

Step 1: Connect to Your Store
The app connects to your Shopify store and downloads all existing products.

Step 2: Read Your EET Pricing File
It reads your eet_prices.txt file and extracts product information including:
- Product names and descriptions
- Prices
- Stock quantities
- Images
- Brand information

Step 3: Filter Products (If Configured)
If you've set up filters in config/product-filter.json, it will:
- Include only the brands or products you want
- Exclude specific brands or products
- Limit the number of products

Step 4: Compare with Your Store
The app compares EET products with your Shopify store and determines:
- New products to add
- Existing products that need updates
- Missing products to hide

Step 5: Add New Products
For new products, the app:
- Creates the product in your Shopify store
- Sets the title, description, and price
- Uploads product images
- Sets stock quantities
- Configures product metadata

Step 6: Update Existing Products
For products already in your store, the app:
- Updates prices from EET
- Updates stock quantities
- Refreshes product information

Step 7: Stock Filtering
Products are filtered based on stock availability:
- If product has stock (local or remote): Product stays ACTIVE
- If product has NO stock available: Product is set to DRAFT (hidden from store)
- Stock levels are checked from EET API in real-time
- Local and remote stock are combined for availability

Step 8: Hide Missing Products
If products are no longer in your EET file:
- They're automatically set to DRAFT status
- They won't appear on your store front

Step 9: Get Real-Time Updates
The app connects to EET API to get:
- Latest prices
- Current stock levels (local, remote, incoming)
- Availability status

- One log file per run

CONFIGURATION GUIDE

Product Filtering

Control which products sync to your store:

Include only specific brands:
{
  "include": {
    "brand": ["Axis", "Hikvision"]
  },
  "exclude": {},
  "include_products_limit": 100
}

Exclude specific products:
{
  "include": {},
  "exclude": {
    "sku": ["OLD001", "TEST001"]
  },
  "include_products_limit": 0
}

Filter Rules Explained

Include:
- If a product's brand OR SKU matches your include list, it will be synced
- Leave empty to sync all products

Exclude:
- If a product's brand AND SKU both match your exclude list, it won't sync
- Matches only one? It still syncs

Limit:
- Set maximum number of products to process
- Set to 0 for no limit
